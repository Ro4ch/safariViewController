Add SFSafariViewController to your project 


If you wanted the Safari Web browser in your project, you can use SFSafariViewController. It is very simple
to implement. I inlcuded code that checks if you have iOS 9 or later and if not it will go out of your app and open Safari.

That code was grabbed from SO - http://stackoverflow.com/a/33929917/5716449
